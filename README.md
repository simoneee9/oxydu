## roadmap

- [x] scan the current workdir and list the files present
- [ ] get each file's logical & physical size
- [ ] print a pretty, formatted output
- [ ] show the size in appropriate units of magnitude (GiB, MiB, B) 
- [ ] add cli args for the target directory and human/machine readable sizes
- [ ] add a cli arg for depth and scan directories recursively until a depth is reached
